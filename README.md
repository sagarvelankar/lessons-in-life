# lessons-in-life

These are the lessons in life which I learnt which would benefit the younger generation

## About me
- I stay in Pune, India.
- I am 39 years old. 
- I am married and have one 8 year old daughter and one 2 year old daughter.
- I was within the top 10 students academically in my school.
- I work as an IT professional.

## Goal
- Set what you are going to do in life when you are a teenager which is when you turn thirteen years of age.
- Start working towards your goal and only do things that are important for your goal.
- Do not be affected by any distractions which are happening around you. There are a lot of distractions like TV, mobile, friends, family, politics, news, sports, etc. You can enjoy them but do not be happy or sad about them. You should always think about your goal while enjoying them.
- Earn money only if it is for achieving your goal.
- Example
    - You may set a life goal that you want to win many Olympic gold medals.
    - Find out which sport will be best for you to win many Olympic gold medals.
    - Start working on this sport when you turn thirteen years of age.
    - Lots of things will try to distract you like news channels and social media showing some celebrity got murdered, some war happening between countries, some economic recession happening, some people losing their jobs, etc. Do not waste your time in following these things. Instead just work towards your life goal of winning many Olympic gold medals.
    - Do not have any affiliation to any political party or religion. People in power in that political party or religion are greedy, psycho people who just want to make money for themselves and their families. They do not care about you. Instead just work towards your life goal of winning many Olympic gold medals.

## School
- Enjoy your time in school with friends.
- Do not worry too much of studies and marks.
- Only study things that are important for your life goal.
- Example 
    - If your life goal is to become a physicist, then study only english, maths and science. There is no need to learn history, other languages like hindi and marathi, arts, social studies, etc. You will just waste your time and energy.
    - Getting good marks in hindi will not help you towards your life goal so just passing marks are enough.
    - But if getting a good university of physics requires you to get good marks in all subjects, then you need to get those marks.
    - But just remember to actually study only english, maths and science in depth and only learn enough in other subjects to get those marks required for achieving your life goal.

## Hobby
- Your life goal should be your hobby.
- You should not earn money doing something else other than your life goal.

## India to USA
- Graduation outside India is very expensive. If you do graduation outside India, then you will be burdened with student loans in your life.
- All your life goals will require you to master something for which you need to do post graduation.
- So, after you finish graduation in India, go for masters degree in USA.
- Do not think of any country except USA.
- Once you finish your masters degree in USA, then work towards your life goal in USA. Do not come back to India. For every life goal, USA is the best country in the world to achieve it.
- India has a lot of problems due to population, corruption, pollution and many other things which I cannot write here. They will distract you. They will waste your time and energy. Everything in India is unfair. Unfairness will create a lot of hurdles in achieving your life goal. You will waste your time and energy overcoming these unfair hurdles.
- Since, I did the biggest mistake of my life of not doing my masters degree in USA, I have never been to USA. So it is better that for your life lessons in USA, you refer to someone else.
- Remaining life lessons are if you made the same mistake as me of staying in India.

## Apartment in India
- Do not buy apartments in India for investment purpose. 
    - Only if you know that the price of the apartment is going to increase because of some government project like airport or connectivity or IT park, then only buy the apartment for investment purpose. 
    - Otherwise, it is better to invest in tax free government schemes like National Pension Scheme, Public Provident Fund, Sukanya Samruddhi Scheme AND/OR in mutual funds.
    - This is because you need to do the following for the apartment which you dont need to do for other investments which give you same or more returns than the apartment.
        - Find tenants
        - Find buyers when you want to sell the property.
        - Ensure tenants pay rent on time
        - Pay monthly society maintenance charges
        - Pay around 10% stamp duty plus GST plus registration charges when you buy the apartment which you never recover
        - Pay annual property tax.
        - Fill all rent paid details properly in your income tax
        - When you sell the apartment, pay Capital Gains Tax on profits from the sale of the apartment ( amount you sold the apartment at minus the amount you bought the apartment at ).
        - Waste your time and energy and charges with the paperwork for buying, selling and renting apartments. There is a lot of paperwork and even if you have a lawyer/agent in India, you need to verify what the lawyer/agent has done since they always make mistakes.
        - Fix any issues in the apartment like leakages, door problems, etc.
        - Read through all the society problems and fights in the society whatsapp group for important messages.
        - Pay charges which the society will levy on you from time to time like fixing the boundary wall because it fell.
        - Keep track of what is the best time to sell the property. Property rates dont increase by a fixed percentage each year. They increase by 30 percent in one year and then they dont increase at all for next 2 years. So best time to sell was when they increased by 30 percent. You need to keep checking every month if someone in your society has sold an apartment and at what price they sold it at. People will sell apartments are lower price and take cash for the remaining amount so you will have to get the correct information from the seller which is hard to get unless you have good relations with them.
- Only buy apartment if you want to live in them
    - Buy apartment only in townships 
        - like Magarpatta City 
            - which has around 100 buildings
            - which has many commercial offices which you can work in and so you do not need to travel outside the township for work.
    - Buy only garden facing flat.
    - Do not buy road facing flat even if it is cheaper because the road vehicle noise may increase in the future due to more vehicles or the road connected in the future to some major road. You should not take the risk.
    - There should be no industrial area or garbage dump within 5 kms radius of your flat.
        - Otherwise you will have smell from that area coming to your flat if your flat is facing it.
        - Even if your flat is not facing it, you will have smell from that area on the podium where you go for a walk or where your children will play.
    - Before you move in, spend as much money as required to renovate the apartment. Till that time continue living on rent. Do not move into the apartment until renovation is complete. It will be a huge headache for you if you try to renovate apartment while you are living in it. If you do not renovate the apartment, then things will break every month and you will waste more time and money getting those issues fixed.
